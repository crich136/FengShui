# FengShui
Interior/exterior home design tool that reads space and caculates dimensions for the best fit for furniture in areas of rooms and areas.
UPDATE
Added new code that asks users for areas of rooms
UPDATE
added new code that can ask users for areas of non square rooms (still needs to apply to more areas but is in wip)
UPDATE
Added a fumction that allows users to see if items are too big for the room, need to ad a function that allows the code to add multiple areas of items instead of just one.
